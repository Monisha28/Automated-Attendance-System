    The aim of the project is to create a system that marks attendance using facial recognition technology in classrooms and storing the record efficiently in excel sheets. The system finds the Known faces and Unknown faces of the student by face recognition using python programming and OpenCV library. The proposed method resolved the problems such as size, lightning and colour of the images from the webcam. The attendance of the student was updated to the Excel sheet with a current timestamp after student's face has been recognized.
